## 🧠 Overview  
This project delves into dataset(s) from Zomato to uncover patterns in restaurant performance, customer behaviour, and delivery trends. Using Excel for data wrangling and Power BI for visualization, the goal was to develop a story around restaurant data that supports strategic decisions in operations, marketing, and location planning.

---

## 💼 Business Context  
In a competitive food-delivery environment, restaurants and aggregators must understand:  
- Which locations or cuisines are under-performing?  
- Are delivery times or costs impacting customer satisfaction?  
- How do restaurant features (ratings, cost for two, city, etc.) correlate with take-away behaviour?  
- What actionable opportunities exist in menus, pricing, or geographical expansion?  

This analysis was built to answer such questions and deliver visual insights that support decision-makers.

## 🧩 Data & Tools  
- **Data Source:** Raw CSV/Excel files obtained from Zomato (restaurant listings, reviews, delivery metrics)  
- **Tools:**  
  - Excel (for cleaning, pivot tables, initial exploration)  
  - Power BI (for interactive dashboards and slicing dimensions)  
- **Techniques Included:** Data cleansing, aggregation, trend-analysis, location-based segmentation, KPI design  

---

## 🛠️ Methodology  
1. Cleaned data in Excel: removed missing/outlier values, formatted fields, created lookup tables  
2. Aggregated relevant metrics (e.g., average ratings by city, delivery count by cuisine)  
3. Imported cleaned data into Power BI to build interactive visualizations:  
   - Geographic maps (city, region)  
   - Trend charts (rating over time, cost vs reviews)  
   - Filters to explore by cuisine, budget, delivery type  
4. Validated insights and created a dashboard designed for business consumption  

---

## 📊 Key Findings  
- Identified cities or neighbourhoods where restaurants had **below-average ratings but high costs**, indicating potential repositioning.  
- Found that certain cuisines (e.g., casual vs premium) showed distinct delivery volumes and review patterns — signalling marketing or menu-strategy opportunities.  
- Observed correlation between “cost for two” and review count varied significantly by city — suggesting value perception differs across regions.  
- Highlighted clusters of restaurants with strong ratings but low take-away counts — possible growth areas with minimal marketing.  

---

## 🖥️ Dashboard Overview  
A user-friendly dashboard was created in Power BI to visualize these insights:  
- Map view of restaurant performance across cities  
- Filters to isolate by cuisine, cost-bucket, rating range  
- Trend and bar charts for key performance metrics  
- Summary-tiles for quick business-reporting

## 🎯 Business Recommendations  
Based on the analysis:  
- **Focus growth** on identified high-rating but low-volume clusters — these represent untapped potential.  
- **Reassess pricing or promotion** in cities where cost for two is high but reviews/volume low.  
- **Use cuisine segmentation** to tailor marketing (e.g., target cuisines with high delivery volumes but lower ratings).  
- **Leverage dashboard** for monitoring monthly performance and guiding decisions on expansion, marketing spend, or menu changes.
